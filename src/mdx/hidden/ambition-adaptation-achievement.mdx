In June 2016, my foray into "CS:GO," introduced by school friends, began innocently enough as a shared pastime. Yet, as their enthusiasm dwindled and I found myself venturing solo, an ambition crystallized within me: to attain the game's apex rank within a span of a year. This journey, embarked upon in solitude, was my first lesson in self-reliance and the power of unwavering determination. Surmounting the odds to reach the top of CS:GO matchmaking was a testament to my capability to excel through personal effort.

The journey didn't end there. In June 2017, discovering Faceit—a platform known for its competitive edge and a fresh ranking system—marked the beginning of a new chapter. Despite starting from the ground up, the goal remained unchanged: to dominate by achieving the highest rank. Success on this platform not only reaffirmed my belief in my solo prowess but also underscored a repeatable pattern of success through perseverance and self-directed learning.

By June 2018, having conquered personal milestones in gaming, I ventured into the competitive scene, a move that necessitated a shift from solo play to integrating into a team. This transition was fraught with challenges. My competitive gaming journey took a pivotal turn during this phase. Accustomed to the autonomy and control of solo play, I struggled to adapt to the collaborative dynamics of team play. My insistence on strategies that favored my individual strengths often came at the expense of team synergy. This approach, while initially seeming to leverage my skills for greater impact, ultimately proved to be a double-edged sword.

The competitive scene laid bare the complexities of teamwork. My reluctance to fully embrace team strategies and the mutual trust required for cohesive play became a stumbling block. Despite my individual talent, the realization dawned on me that success in a team context required more than just personal skill; it necessitated a melding of minds and strategies. My failure to align with team principles not only hampered our collective success but also highlighted my shortcomings as a teammate.

This period of introspection was crucial. It underscored the stark contrast between solo achievements and the collaborative essence of team success. The lessons were hard-earned but invaluable, teaching me that the path to excellence in a team environment is paved with compromise, adaptability, and the humility to blend one's strengths with the collective good.

In the five years leading up to 2024, I embarked on a self-directed hobby into the world of finance, a domain as intricate and demanding as any strategy game I had mastered. This period was marked by rigorous study and the application of analytical skills honed in the virtual arenas of competitive gaming. 

I can't help but offer myself a note of personal congratulations. Over the past eight years, starting from those early days of competitive gaming to the recent strides in the financial markets, my self-devised method of learning and analysis has not faltered once. This unbroken streak of success serves as a testament to the effectiveness of my approach, blending rigorous self-study with the strategic insights honed through gaming.

Looking ahead, I stand on the threshold of a significant milestone. The insights gained and the convictions held, especially following the signals detected in October 2023 and their confirmation in November, have positioned me to potentially retire within the next five years. This prospect is not just a measure of financial success but a reflection of the adaptability, resilience, and foresight that have been the hallmarks of my journey.

However, the path to this point has been about more than just achievements. It has been a process of continuous learning and refinement. Should the next five years not culminate in retirement, it will not denote failure but rather an opportunity to further refine my learning method. Each step of the way, from the challenges of solo gaming to the complexities of financial analysis, has contributed to a robust and adaptable approach to problem-solving and decision-making.

This journey underscores a crucial insight: the value of a method lies not only in its successes but also in its capacity to evolve. The past eight years without a single failure highlight the strength of my approach, yet the true measure of its worth will be how it adapts to and learns from whatever the future holds.

To my future self, congratulations on your determination and the successes you've achieved. Whether retirement is on the horizon or not, take pride in the knowledge that your unique method of analysis has brought you this far and will continue to guide you in the years to come. Remember, the journey is as valuable as the destination, and the skills and insights you've gained are the true treasures of your endeavors.
