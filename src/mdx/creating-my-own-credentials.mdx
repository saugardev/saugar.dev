We live in a complex society that requires a credential as a proof of knowledge. This practice appears strongly blurry in my perspective, as it seems that people merely aim to acquire a degree.

## Adaptability in a Fast-Changing Environment

In a rapidly evolving environment, it is not the strongest, but rather those with the greatest adaptability who rise to the top. For the last five years, I have been immersing myself in the world of technology, reaching a point where I must create my own credentials. I've previously touched on this in [my first blog](/my-journey-begins), where I mentioned that I would be writing about tech articles and sharing recent developments.

## Crafting a Personal Roadmap

Creating my own credentials requires a carefully planned roadmap. Unlike traditional roadmaps that are designed to facilitate learning about a subject, mine will guide me closer to my current goals and the place I want to be.

This roadmap will encompass writing about various topics, including:

### Frontend Development:

**Angular:** A powerful and widely-used framework. I'll be writing about it to explain its flexibility in building scalable web applications.

**Next.js:** Known for server-side rendering, Next.js allows for better SEO and performance. I'll cover its unique features and how it integrates with various other tools.

**React:** One of the most popular libraries for building user interfaces, React's component-based architecture is a must-explore topic, and I'll dive into its best practices and use cases.

**TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that enhances design productivity. My writings will focus on how it enables rapid design changes and promotes maintainable CSS.

**Typescript:** Adding static type definitions to JavaScript, TypeScript ensures safer and more robust code. I'll highlight its advantages and the development efficiency it provides.

### Backend Technologies:

**Nestjs:** A progressive Node.js framework that is versatile for building efficient applications. I'll discuss its modular structure and how it simplifies complex back-end development.

**Nodejs:** The backbone of many modern web applications, I'll explore how Node.js fosters scalable and performant back-end development.

**Bun (after its release on September 7):** As a new and promising technology, I'll review Bun upon its release, providing insights into its features and potential impact.

**Software patterns:** Understanding software design patterns is essential for clean and efficient code. I'll delve into commonly used patterns and their practical applications.

### Systems & CI/CD Tools:

**Docker:** Containerization is a vital aspect of modern development, and I'll cover how Docker facilitates consistent and portable environments.

**Github Actions:** Automating workflows can save immense time, and Github Actions is at the forefront of this. I'll share how it can be customized for different project needs.

**Jenkins:** A widely used automation tool, Jenkins offers a range of plugins for build and deployment automation. I'll outline its capabilities and benefits.

**AWS:** As a leading cloud provider, AWS's tools and services are crucial for scalable applications. I'll detail its various components and how they integrate into development pipelines.

### Blockchain:

**Sharing the latest developments with tools using blockchain:** I'll keep abreast of the latest tools and developments, sharing insights on how they can be applied and their implications for the future.

## Beyond the Degree

By delving into all these different topics, I aim not only to share knowledge but also to demonstrate my expertise in a manner that transcends traditional college degrees. In a world where adaptability is paramount, creating my own credentials is an innovative approach to validating my skills and knowledge.
