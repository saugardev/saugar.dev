In my observations of our professional and personal journeys, I often sense that many of us are meandering through life and careers without a clear end goal. Intriguingly, there's a common desire to achieve more, yet frequently, there's a lack of deep thought or effort put into actually attaining these ambitions. It's as if we are traveling without a fixed destination, while simultaneously yearning for greater heights but not strategizing or working diligently to reach them.

---

We continually face a challenging environment where the majority of us begin at a disadvantage, often due to a lack of awareness or interest in studying and understanding the world around us. It's a scenario where gaining an edge over others often hinges on our willingness to delve deeper into our surroundings. This knowledge gap not only impedes our progress but also leaves us unprepared to navigate the complexities of our professional and personal lives.

I believe that only a few people possess the capability to lead and, consequently, to make decisions. This applies not just to leading others, but also to self-leadership. This deficiency has far-reaching implications in various aspects of life where we all supposedly have equal rights. Indirectly, it creates a disparity, as not everyone is equally prepared or willing to take charge and make informed decisions. This situation perpetuates inequality, even in settings where equality is ostensibly a given.

Another challenge in today's society is our relationship with attention and immediacy. We are living in an era with more opportunities than ever before, yet only a few manage to make a significant leap in their personal lives or create a substantial social impact. A core issue we face is our inability to focus on what truly matters, coupled with a desire for immediate gratification. This often results in negligible outcomes or, in many cases, a complete lack of results. Our collective short-sightedness and impatience hinder the realization of substantial achievements, despite the abundance of opportunities at our disposal.

The lack of understanding of our surroundings, the inability to make decisions, and the insatiable craving for immediacy prevent us from setting our sights on achieving significant milestones. We dream big, but, in my opinion, we plan solely for failure. Thereâ€™s a widespread reluctance to endure 1, 2, or even 5 years of hard work necessary to achieve outcomes that could far exceed our initial expectations. This impatience and short-sightedness not only limit our potential achievements but also lead us to underestimate the value of persistence and long-term effort in realizing truly remarkable success.

We are afflicted by a societal illness that restricts our ability to see beyond what we are taught. This very education acts as the fuel for this ailment. It instills a tunnel vision in us, blinding us to the possibilities that lie beyond. However, this constricted perspective is not only socially accepted but also revered, with many considering it necessary. This paradigm shackles us to a form of thinking that is too predictable, yielding outcomes that are just as foreseeable. We're entrapped in a cycle of conformity, where our thinking is dictated by established norms, stifling innovation and broader perspectives.

If two identical individuals were placed in different environments, they would undoubtedly evolve into different people. Our skills, thoughts, and aspirations are significantly influenced by our surroundings. This leads to an intriguing question: should we, or could we, even judge the decisions of others who exist in a context different from our own? Perhaps our critiques should focus not on the individual but rather on the environmental factors that shape a person's decisions.

Studying the consequences of your actions is how you prepare for the future. Whether you succeed or fail, you should be ready.

When we debate about freedom in situations where it is already present, it's possible that we're unwittingly addressing the emergence of a subtle, yet insidious form of tyranny.
